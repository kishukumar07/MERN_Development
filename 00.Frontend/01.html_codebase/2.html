<!-- here its too hard to use comment so just use (ctrl + forward slash) -->


<html>
<head> 
<!--   NON DIRECT THINGS(NOT RELATED TO THE WEB PAGE) WILL GO INSIDE HEAD TAG - 
  eg. tittle of a webpage is not directly related to the web page -->
<title>HERE WHAT WE WRITE IT WILL BE A TITTLE</title>

</head>
<body>
    <!-- DIRECT THINGS (DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE WEB PAGE)WILL GO INSIDE BODY TAG -->
 
<!-- heading tag -->
<h1>Heading -1</h1>

<!-- paragraph tag -->
 <p>paragraph here</p>

<!-- ANCHOR TAG -->
 <!-- hyper link- from one webpage we can open any other new page
 eg. ships use anchor to connect with the shore or beach with the boad
 just like this we have anchor tag in html just to link one page to other -->
<a>google</a>
<!-- but this will not open google - I have to tell the anchor tag which link to visit
and for this we have to understand ATTRIBUTES FIRST -->
<!-- eg..the basic feature of phone is calling but we want some more features like camera
    flash , location etc..
so we can say these are the ATTRIBUTES for the phone
and same we have to give ATTRIBUTES to anchor tag ,,,
and we can write ATTRIBUTES in opening anchor tag ,,, -->
<a href="https://students.masaischool.com/">Masai school</a>
<!-- now when you click on the hyper text this will open the link you gave to anchor tag
as ATTRIBUTES; (herf mean hyper reference)

but the link will opening in the same page and we must have to open in another PAGE
this can be done using one more attributes called target -->

<a href="https://students.masaischool.com/" target="_blank">Masai school</a>
 
With using attribute target="_blank" this will open the link in new PAGE
(WE HAVE TO REMEMBER TWO ATTRIBUTES FOR anchor TAG 1.Herf="link_here"(href allows me to provide the link )   2. target ="_blank"(
target provide us to target where to open new webpage))


we have done heading ,para and anchor tag we also learnt about attributes 

<!-- SOME OTHER TAG CALLED AS LISTS -->
