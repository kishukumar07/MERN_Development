                      SCORES OF VARIOUS SELECTORS
                      SELECTOR NAME        SCORES
  Inline(direct with select tag)             1000
                         id                 100
                     Class                  10
                       Tag                  1
                       Universal            0 
if the value  is conflicting then the score value is getting checked  
whichever has the higher score values that css will be applied
if there are condn where both have same score value then the last one is applied 

 
whenever we are working with the css we need to care of these things
1. if any of the values are conflicting or not 
2. what are the selector has been used like tag class class 
3. write down the scores of ALL
4. find the higer score value 
5. which one comes later if the score value is same 
forthis try practical 
 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  
  <title>conflicting the value</title>
  <style>
    
  h1{
color: red;
    height :  5px;
  }
    .clr{
      color: aqua;
    }
    #pas
    {
      font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="clr">Heading-1</h1>
  <h1 class="clr">Heading-2</h1>
  <h1>Heading-3</h1>
  <h1 id="pas">Heading-4</h1>
  <h1>Heading-5</h1>
</body>
</html>
<!-- just we have to know a more little bit about selectors --> 
    lets build a movie website with selectors we already done in previous casses
