Types of selector
tag selector
class selector
id selector
universal selector


why we are learning selector itself?
 DRY-> don't Repeat yourself 
 let assume we have four button and we have to increase size of four buttons how will 
 we do it just using css attribute name font size:size px;  in each buttons.
 thats oky but what if we have 100 buttons
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
 <head>
  <title>selectors</title>
using style element here for css 
<style>
  /* here we have to tell the style tag that for which tag what css styling we add */
  button{
    background-color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
  }
  
  /* with the single line of code we are catching all the buttons of the page  and this is much more cleaner we can say */
  /* this is tag selector whatever we did bcs we using this as tag */
 
</style>
 the tag selector is oky to apply same style in all botton but what if we want to apply style A for 3 button and Style B for next two button (let make buttons naming 3 indian and 2 outer player inside html body element )



 using class selector for colouring the indian and outer buttons
 for indian

 








 </head>
 <body>

<!-- 
<button style="font-size: 20px;">1</button>
<button style="font-size: 20px;">2</button>
<button style="font-size: 20px;">3</button>
<button style="font-size: 20px;">4</button> 
-->
<button>1</button>
<button>2</button>
<button>3</button>
<button>4</button>
<button>5</button>
its not viable and looks to ugly for that
we can acctually write css not directly in tag.
we can use WRITE CSS IN MAKING A STYLE TAG INSIDE ALWAYS IN HEAD TAG
INside this   style element we can write our css
