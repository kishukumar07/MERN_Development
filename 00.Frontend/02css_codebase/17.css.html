    the tag selector is oky to apply same style in all botton but what if we want to apply style A for 3 button and Style B for next two button (let make buttons naming 3 indian and 2 outer player inside html body element )


 using class selector for colouring the indian and outer buttons
for indian
<style>
    /* defining one class for indian buttons  */
.indian{
color: orange; 
}
/* <!-- defining class for non indian  --> */

.outer{
    color: blue;
}
/* now we have to give the button their classes */
/* THATS HOW CLASS SELECTER WORKS 
    YOU DEFINE THE CLASS ONLY ONCE GIVING CLASS ATTRIBUTE YOU CAN APPLY STYLE TO THE ELEMENT  */
    /* what if we remove dots in front of the class - it will going to find that exact tag name like class name - indian but it not found such tags so we have to use dots telling that find 
    the  class name not tag */

</style>
    

/* 
THATS ALL WE HAD IN A CLASS SELECTOR  */
