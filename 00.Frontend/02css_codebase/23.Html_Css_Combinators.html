<!-- What comes to mind about the word combinators -somthing combining right 
~we will combine selectors to catch any element 

THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT COMBINATORS IN CSS: 

*descendant selector (space)
*child selector (>)
*general sibling selector (~)
*adjacent sibling selector (+)
 
why we need is selector not enough>?
=> think logically what if you have to colour all the h1 tags inside the container 
if you use tag selector then it will applied also to the outside container h1 element
if you use class selector then you have to give each element the class leanthy process
so what if we use 
 .container h1{
    style here 
}  
~this is descendant selector 
and give the class to the container only 
yeh it is simple and easy to use 
(this is combinators )

*difference bw the child and descendant
lets assume three generation 
GRANDFATHER (harivasnsh rai bacchan)
FATHER(child of harivasnsh)
child  (decendant of harivasnsh)
cild's child(decendant)
here i am descendant and the father is child  (understood the differrence bw the decendant and the child )
  -->


  

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    
    <title>Document</title>


     <style>
            /* <!-- using decendant selector for styling the specific element inside the container  -->  */
        .container h1 {
            background-color:  yellow;
        }
        /* using child(greater than symbol )selector and see the same thing   */
    .container > h1{
    color: red;
    }


     </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Heading-6</h1>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Heading-1</h1>
        <h1>heading-2</h1>
        <h1>heading-3</h1>
        <h1>heading-4</h1>
        <h1>heading-5</h1>

        <!-- now below we have one more container and inside that container we have one more h1 tag
        this heading tag is very special because this is not directly inside the previous container but inside the container which is inside the previous container -->
        <div>

            <h1> Headign inner</h1>
        
        </div>
        <!-- so wheever we using decendant selector it doesnt matter how much nested divs inside one div ,the style written in that decendant selector will applied to all element  -->

        now going with the child selector you defined inside style tag 
        the style is only applied to the child  element of the parent div's only 
        (it selects the element direct one only ).
        as u can see the text colour is not applied in headding inner but the 
        background-color is applied to all heading(1-6)
        as well as the inner-heading(nested div same element)
        <div>
    <p>para</p>
</div> 
    </div>
 



    
<h1>Heading-7 </h1>



</body>
</html>





Now we learnt about the decendent selectors and the child selector
