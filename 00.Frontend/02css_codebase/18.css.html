LET SAY FROM ALL THE INDIAN PLAYERS YOU WANT TO ONLY GIVE DHONY - MAN OF THE MATCH
YOU WANT TO SELECT ONLY ONE TAG NOT MULTIPLE  
WE CAN USE ID SELECTOR FOR THIS 
YOU CAN USE THE THING WITH STYLE TAG AS WELL  BUT FROM NOW ON WE WE WILL FOLLOW A RULE THAT
WE WANT BE WRITTING ANY STLYE WITH THE STYLE ATTRIBUTE 
why the reason its not good looking &not good practice 


we all get till now our html and css get separated completely
 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    
    <title>Id selector </title>

<style>

/* you can not use . bcs man-of-the-match is not the class  for id we have a sepatate sign its # */
    /* for tags there is no sign 
    for class there is . 
    for id there is # */
/* for one particular element we can use id (id should not be duplicated mean you can not use same id for more than one  element,one single html page we can use one id for once only)*/
/* you can use multiple id's to one element   */



#man-of-the-match
    {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
  


</style>
</head>
<body>
       <!-- we have to give man of the match -for only dhoni 
for dhoni i have given the id attribute now i have to define the style for it 
and for it we have to go in the body part -->
<button id="man-of-the-match" >Dhoni</button> 
<button >Raina</button>
<button >Jadega</button>
<button>Adam Milne</button>
 <button>Chris Jordon</button>

<!-- thats all we learnt about tag selector , class selector and id selector  -->
<!-- we can apply multiple selector to one element eg. u can define a class name batsman containg border and give it to the same element "dhoni" -->
