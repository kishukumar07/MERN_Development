Your Template will have 3 files
HTML (index.html - Don't change any ID's in this file)
CSS (index.css)
JS (index.js)


Problem Statement:-
Your app consists a form which contain 1 input tag and 1 select tag
Note : HTML tags are already in template.
Form will take
Task Name
Priority (select tag)
On form submit, display this data in form of table (thead is already in place just append to tbody)
Input tags already in template, just finish script part.
Each row should have 3 columns (td)
Task Name
Priority
If priority is high, it should have red background, else green background.
In each row, there should be a Favourite column and on clicking that do nothing, we will implement this tomorrow.
Make sure you follow all rules of forms.
