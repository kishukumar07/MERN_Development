//the queation is how can i loop over the data and show it on the dom how to do that 
// lets creat a container inside the body and there we'll append there all the data 
// the first thing is to catch the div (i created )
let puppyCont =document.getElementById("puppy-container");
// catching puppy-container div using a reference variable puppyCont
  
//creating a function read code line 144  we replaced the PuppyData with the data parameter 
//& passing argument as puppydata at first 
DisplayPuppies(PuppyData); 
function DisplayPuppies(data){
puppyCont.innerHTML =""; 
//  next thing is we have to run the loop on the data (on puppydata given data )
   for (let i=0; i<data.length; i++ ){

// inside the for loop i have to creat the cart(structure we created below the body of html  ) and within the cart we have to creat all items given in the element of the data 

let puppy = document.createElement("div"); 
// we creat a div stored it in a reference variable name puppy and we have to append this div inside the puppy-cont 

// and within this puppy div we have to append the image first then name then bread 
// so first let creat the image with using reference variable let say img 

let img = document.createElement("img"); 
//now let set the attribute of the image
img.setAttribute("src", data[i].img); //we are setting the img src 
// now we'll append this image iside puppy (the reference variable we declared with a element div under the main containerdiv ) 

// let creat name and bread then we'll append alll these stuffs in the puppy 
let name =document.createElement("h2");
//we created a name variable holding a element h2 for  name of the puppy 
//lets add the value to it 
name.innerText = data[i].name; 


//let creat bread 
let bread = document.createElement("h2"); 
bread.innerText = data[i].bred; 




//lets append 
puppy.append(img,name,bread); 

puppyCont.append(puppy); 

   }
  
  
  
                          }
// NOW IF YOU SEE THERE IS LOT OF PUPPY DATA GIVEN BUT THERE IS OF ONLY TWO BREAD 1.HUSKY 2.Pitbull AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THE FILLER ON THE BASIS OF THESE TWO CHOICES 
// ~for this we created a select tag withing the body having two options for selecting the bread value 
// now we have to creat such code if we select husky only husky bread puppy is visible and when we select the Pitbull only pitbulls are visible (we are not selecting we are changing the value -Event name ----CLICK----) 



// !First we have to catch the select tag  by id   

let filterSelect = document.getElementById("filter"); 
 
//now we have to add event when event  change occurs 
filterSelect.addEventListener("change",function(){
//here we have to do the our actuall filtering thing 
//~we'll run the array.filter hof for filtering the given data on the array of puppydata
//you have to check the file index1basic.js for understanding the filter HOF
let filtered = PuppyData.filter(function(element){
//whatever i selected the value how can i get ~ by --filterSelect.value(filterSelect is variable that is used as ref.var for catching the select tag )
 console.log(filterSelect.value); 
 //whenever you select the value at application pannel the value of select tag getting printed by the console.log(filterSelect.value);  
if(element.bred=== filterSelect.value){
    return true; 
}
else {
    return false ; 
}
});
console.log(filtered); //this will print those element which bread value you changed to the select tag it will console  in the application Pannel
// it will not updating the dom we have to update it so lets write the code for this 




// till code_line 64 to 100 is responsible for updating the dom


// so if i copy the whole code and paste it here just with changing puppydata to filltered is it  going to work what do you think?
// yes we just have to run the same code again ---but the again writting code is too burden and not viable to use 
// solution: bfr that code lines we have to creat a function 
DisplayPuppies(filtered); 
//now this will add a a new data below the old data  (no any visible change) //so we'll  add line no
