     <!-- how can i catch element with other thing we learnt how to catch element with  id  -->
      <div class="cont">
        <h1 class="head">Heading-1</h1>
        <h1 class="head">Heading2</h1>
        <h1 class="head">Heading3</h1>
      </div>

<script>
 // getElementsByid(here we pass id) ~id is used for single so we were catching a single element but
    let headings =document.getElementsByTagName("h1"); //here we have catching by tag name and that is plural so we can catch multiple element (here we have to pass all the different tags(tag_name))
//    lets check what we caught with the getElementsByTagName("h1")
// console.log(headings); //all heading tag is printed in object format
 

//  if i want to store 3 names what is the best way ~ Array (same types of value)
//  but what if i have to store a name and age(no) ~objects(different types of value) 
//  Thats why the console will give all headings(whatever tags we caught with .getElementsByTagName(tag) ) in array format  


 
// here we have to run loop  to catch inner things as previously we were used .innerText or .value for acessing the text of elements

for(let i=0; i<headings.length; i++){
    console.log(headings[i].innerText); 
}
//we can also use for each and map hof in place of for loop 
// lets catch headings with the class which is given to each heading element

let heading2 = documentElementByClassName("head"); 
//here we have to provide the name of the class as parameter
// console.log(heading2); lets check

// and same here also we have to run loop if we want to print all the text withing the headings 

for(let i=0; i<heading2.length; i++){
    console.log(heading2[i].innerText); 
}

// so every thing cleared how to catch element with id, tagname and classname (id ,tag ,class selector done )


// NOW WE WE LEARN HOW TO  CATCH ElemenTS WTIH COMBINATOR SELECTORS
//in html css can we use the child selector or decendent (both) for selecting all the h1 element inside div .cont >h1 /.cont h1 
// Same thing we use for js also like..
// .querySelectorAll(here you have to give the combinator) note whenever we are using the query Selector we must use css symbols of selectors ./#/* bfr class or bfr id (for defining whatever css combinators we define query selector~here we can apply all the css selecting rules ); 
let headings3 =doucument.querySelectorAll(".cont >h1");  //this will catch only child  
let heading4 =doucument.querySelectorAll("h1"); //this will catch all the heading tag universally  
console.log(headings3);  //array


// we have one small thing:- which is HEADING SINGLE
//  this is bcs querryselector will catch all the elements the que is how to select all the element that is done by justt .querryselector

let headingsingle =document.querySelector(".cont >h1") ; //this will catch only 1stheading
// here you can pass all the css catching combinators but this will only going to catch the first element of the entire elements 
console.log(headingsingle); //lets check  ~we can see that only heading 1 is printed in the console pannel

RECAP:-
THE FIRST THING :how to catch element by tag 
what is the difference b/w getElementByTagName("xyzz") and 
getElementByClassName("") is 
 by tag is singular and by class is plural 

NExt thing is : headings should be stored in array format so whenever we have to acess any element  we have to use loops.

Next thingg catching the element with the classname 


the next thing is catching the elements with combinators 
there  are meathods querySelectorall to catch all the elemtnt   it is stored in the array format .so we need to run loop for acessing elements
NOTE we have to use the combinator symbol before 



what is the difference b/w the querySelector(its going to catch only one and first element ) and querySelectorAll(it is going to catch all the element )
