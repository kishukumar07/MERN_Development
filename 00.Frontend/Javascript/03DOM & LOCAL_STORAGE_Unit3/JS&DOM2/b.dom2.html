    let numberPads= document.querySelectorAll("#numbers > button");
//   how to add specific events for every single buttons   
// can i catch one single element using this? numberPads[0]  
//  numberPads[0].addEventListner("click, LogNumber"); 
//  .addEventListner("1st paramete  is event name(just click) ,2nd parameter is function name (not a function call)   ") ~this also works not only for buttons only but also with divs and images 

// now lets put the whole thing inside a loop for covering all the elemetns 
// NOTE :EVENT RELETED ATTRIBUTE ALWAYS WORKS WITH on but the actual event is after on  --onclick 
for(let i=0; i < numberPads.length; i++){
//this is same as higher order function we  just pass the function  we dont call it 
    // numberPads[i].addEventListener("click",LogNumber);  
    // with this we can not pass anything to the function bcs we are not calling(it will auto be executed ) it 
    // so we can replace function name from here with an anonomus function and able to call the function inside this anonomus fun 
    numberPads[i].addEventListener("click",function(){
        LogNumber(numberPads[i].innerText); 
    });
    // now we are able to pass and call my function  first addEventListener function is going to call anonomus funtn and anonomus will call the actual funtn
}  
function LogNumber(i) {
    console.log(i); 
}
 

// TOPIC EVENT OBJECT -  what happens is that  whatever events is occouring here they have some data here  and js stores that events data  in the single object  i.e known as event object.
//  try to passs xyz/event/e as argument in the previous anonomous function and console it inside that anonomous funtn you will see all the records  of all the events like:-- 
// numberPads[i].addEventListener("click", function(e){
//         console.log(e); 
// one thing is here what if e is object and we acess its targget key
// console.log(e.target); ~this will tell you that on which element  you are taking on (cicking)
// one more thing if we use 
// console.log(e.target.innerText);  what will happen think! it will going to print the inner text (acessing innertext) of that element which i am touching  
//  CONCLUSION /application: using this we can actually acess which element is on action or being activated });

RECAP:- 
here we learnt how we add the event not using attributes but with a method .addEventListner("nameoftheevent" , functionneme of function(){function1(parameter) }) justpassing aurgument with the help of  anonomus function at- 2nd parameter .
Usecases -
when we have multiple element and in that case adding the events one by one is not viable there we use (simmilar element)


now one more thing if i pass a parameter what it will give ? eventobject(object)

howcan i catch the element of the eventobject
== event.target  this will give that element which is at action
