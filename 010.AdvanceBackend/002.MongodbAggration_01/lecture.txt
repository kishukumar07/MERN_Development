Aggregation -Aggregate

Aggregate -> what do u understand by it ? => is to collect something 


Find all the students in a school, count the no of boys and girls, then you want to find average marks of each group in xyz evaluation , again do some operation on that

===>>How will you do it  with normal query
              const  boysgroup = db.collection.find({gender: "male"})
              const  girlsgroup = db.collection.find({gender: "Female"})
                 

           const  boyscount =boygroup.length; 
           const  girlscount =girlgroup.length;
           const totalStudents = boysgroup.length+girlsgroup.length     


and so on.....for finding avg marks ......for each group ........ its getting complex
