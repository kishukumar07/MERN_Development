<!-- what is dom? it is something given to js by broweser. 
lets see how to connect our html with js page.
we have to creat a script element and we write js codes as a content of this element which is writen always after the body  tag of html  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
/* <!-- we have different way to catch a html element with css ~tag ,class,id,combinators --> */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 id="head">Getting stated with dom and js</h1> 
   <button onclick="console.log('hello world')">BTN</button>
  
   <!-- same thing we are going to do with divs but with function approach read the line 45 -->
   <div onclick="MyOnClick();">div BTN</div>
   <button onclick="MyOnClick();">BTN2</button>
</body>
<!-- we have to creat a script element and we write js codes as a content of this element which is writen always after the body  tag of html  -->
<script>
// console.log("DOm Starts"); 
// // whatever js we learnt but we didnt know how to deal connect these js codes with the html elements ~DOM(document object model)
//js directly do not understand the syntax of html so what the browser does is they convert the html in a object called document(we dont need to creat this this is given by browser auto) and thats why the dom is called as document object model and now js understand this 
// console.log(document); 
// IN JS WE ARE JUST FOCUS ON CATCHING A ELEMENT WITH ID ONLY 
// console.log(document.getElementById("head")); 
// we can do the same thing using a reference variable
let headingEl = document.getElementById("head");
// console.log(headingEl); 
// you can see the h1 tag is printed now 
console.log(headingEl.innerText); 
// we were trying to acess the innerText of the element tag(heading tag)
// headingEl.innerText="some Random Text"; //we are trying to change the inner text of heading element here
// INNER TEXT 


// NOW I WANT , WHEN I CLICK ON BUTTON , ITS SOMETHING TO DO 
// AND FOR THIS WE HAVE TO LEARN A SMALL CONCEPT 



// EVENT-LISTNER(we difine events and when ever this events happens we going to run the specific code)
// so lets understand it see the butoon element has given a js code through oneclick attribute 
 
// whats the problem is if i want to write a complex code should we not use functions like 
function MyOnClick() {
    // console.log('hello world');
    // console.log('button clicked ')
    headingEl.innerText="some Random Text";
}
 
</script>
