<!-- Going start with FETCH-->
<!-- use -to get the data from the backend or the server  -->

API- IS A BRIDGE B/W THE CLIENT AND SERVER 
?dom is also an api 
the type of api we are going to learn is rest" API" -it is the work of the backend developer to develope this api 

In the internet we have many open- free source "API".. (json placeholder api -one of the most popular api ) 
there many api are present !! we are going to use them 
"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"

*after fetching the url in new tab -you will see the json (stringifyed) format (that's mean whenever we get the data we are getting it in json format/stringifyed) 
*api is like url :  jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

const APIURL ='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'; //we have now our API now we'll learn how to get data from the API in our code _      THE METHOD NAME IS FETCH ITS A FUNCTION IT TAKES API AS PARAMETER

fetch(APIURL) //it IS JUST A FUNCTION : returns the new promise 
// let data =fetch(APIURL) //it returns the new promise 
// console.log(data); (by default promises are asyncronous so writing code directly after it willnot going to work  ) so we have to write 
.then((response)=>{  //.this is THE WAY OF RESOLVING THE PROMISE 
// console.log(response);  //THIS WILL PRINT RESPONSE OBJECT  -- A LOT OF STUF ALSO HAVING BODY:READABLESTREAM (SMALLER PACKETS_DATA IS COMMING LITTLE BY LITTLE ->THIS WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME SO WHENEVER IT TAKES LOT OF TIME WE USE PROMISE THERE ) ..I CANT USE DIRECTLY SO I HAVE TO GET AND CONVERT IT INTO ARRAY OR OBJECT FORMAT ..SO WE CAN USE 
return response.json(); // THIS ALSO RETURN A PROMISE _SO THIS IS promise chaining 
//why this is called as json format~reason? read backend line  50 
})
.this ((data)=>{ //.this is the way for resolving the promise 
console.log(data); //if all resolved i will get my actual data 
})
.catch((err)=>{  //.catch just only one time 
console.log("error happened!"); 
console.log(err); 
})
//first promise  is for resquest and 2nd promise we have to convert the readable stream to our required format 


//0-1 in internet data travel in either 0 or 1,can i directly convert a program into 0 and 1 ? 
// (array and object _they directly do donot getting converted in 0s and 1s so we have to convert it into json format (string )and this can be easily converted into 0s and 1s )
//BACKEND- > ARRAY,OBJECT -> JSON ->0,1->READABLESTREAM (PACKET) ~WE GET->JSON->array,object
